                    <p>Dialogica is a suite of products for orchestrating the whole digital touchpoint creation process in an enterprise context. </p>
                    <p>From a technical standpoint this was the most challenging and therefore most rewarding application I have ever worked on. The application contained many engineering challenges like realtime collaborative editing and diagramming. Modern development techniques like functional reactive programming were used to create a responsive and collaborative experience.  It was built with AngularJS and a NodeJS backend.</p> 
                    <p>On this project I worked primarily as a front-end architect and lead developer, but was also involved in the concept development.</p>

                    <h2>UX/UI Design</h2>
                    <p>My education Industrial Design Engineering gives me a good basis in the theory and practice of design processes. For me design starts with a thorough understanding of the domain and the users. With a solid understanding of the problem space on a conceptual level, design of the application structure and screens is a lot more straightforward.</p>
                    <p>When it comes to detailed screen design, I have a strong eye for detail and knowlegde about the 'use qualities' that are important for a good user experience. My goal is always to create modular, component-driven design systems instead of separate screen designs.</p>
                    <p>I have worked as a Interaction Designer for both large enterprises and small companies and have made designs for different kinds of platforms like web, Windows, embedded applications and early mobile (Vodafone Live!).</p>

                    <h2>Front-end development</h2>
                    <p>In the past 15 years I have been developing all kinds of web sites and applications. Both simple web sites and complex web applications. I have worked on many different front-end engineering challenges like diagramming, realtime collaboration, WYSIWYG editing, complex drag and drop, PDF generation and many more.</p>
                    <p>I have a strong focus on quality, both from a technical and design standpoint. Quality to me is not about how smart you are as a single programmer, but more about being thoughtfull and deliberate in your daily coding practice. Validation and communication of decisions within a team is very important to me. I take pride in creating well structured and thought-through codebases.</p>
                    <p>My technical skill set includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Expert level JavaScript, HTML and CSS skills (also ES6/7 and TypeScript) </li>
                        <li>Experience with multiple SPA frameworks (Angular 2/4, AngularJS, Knockout, React, Backbone)</li>
                        <li>Understanding of various programming paradigms and patterns</li>
                        <li>Knowledge of modern front-end development tooling</li>

                    <p>This project allowed me to design a new concept for supporting the paint processes in a car repair shop. Next to the Windows application it also consisted of accompanying scales with small monochrome LCD displays.</p>
                    <p>I was responsible for concept design and detailed UI design.</p>

                    <p>While working at Informaat I have spent a lot of time at client locations. This allowed me to experience different kinds of organizational cultures. Some examples are ABN AMRO, Vodafone, Kluwer and Essent @Home.</p>

                    <p>This project started my love for JavaScript. The client wanted something that really stood out from the norm. The DHTML era had just started so we went full-blown with these new browser capabilities. The website makes heavy use of javascript animations (but in a subtle way). The Cultuurnota site already used asynchronous content loading in a time where AJAX wasn't invented yet.</p>
                    <p>On this project I was responsible for all front-end development.</p>
